In the Main file, the system data is loaded (you can adapt any system, it is generated in matpower format), in this article the Garver system (Garver.m) is considered. Subsequently, the PJM 2016 system data (2016_hourly_loads.xls) is used to obtain load behaviour patterns. Using clustering techniques (Kmeans), the required scenarios are generated. You can adapt your own demand patterns by generating a data matrix of the type [Days,Hours].  
Once the scenarios are generated, the stochastic expansion model is run with the previously obtained load uncertainty patterns. 
The final expansion plans, operating and investment costs are obtained, and the constraints are checked to ensure that they meet the following requirements.
